# AdventOfCode2025
Set of solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2025 written in Python.

Code has been written to solve the problems as written. It does not consider edge cases unless they affect finding the desired solution and, in some places, due to the dataset supplied it will only find solutions in a narrow range of cases.

This is the interesting aspect of a set of puzzles like AoC. Many coding challenges give a range of test cases, and your code needs to be ready for a variety of circumstances. With AoC looking at the data set supplied can narrow the problem space and make a simplistic solution viable that could not be used in a "real world" situation where the input data can change.
